## Introduction

Welcome to the Day 1 of the AUGUSTHON -- 30 Days of Python Challenge! This code demonstrates basic arithmetic operations and data type checking in Python. Whether you're a complete beginner or just brushing up on your skills, this README will explain every line of code in detail.

## Code Explanation

### Arithmetic Operations

```python
print(2 + 5)   # addition(+)
```
- This line adds the numbers 2 and 5 together. The `+` operator is used for addition. The result, which is 7, is printed to the console.

```python
print(5 - 1)   # subtraction(-)
```
- Here, we subtract 1 from 5. The `-` operator is used for subtraction. The result, 4, is printed.

```python
print(2 * 5)   # multiplication(*)
```
- This line multiplies 2 by 5 using the `*` operator. The result, 10, is printed.

```python
print(5 / 2)   # division(/)
```
- In this line, we divide 5 by 2 using the `/` operator. The result is 2.5, which is printed.

```python
print(5 ** 2)  # exponential(**)
```
- This line calculates 5 raised to the power of 2 using the `**` operator. The result is 25, which is printed.

```python
print(5 % 2)   # modulus(%)
```
- The modulus operator `%` gives the remainder of the division of 5 by 2. Here, the result is 1, which is printed.

```python
print(5 // 2)  # Floor division operator(//)
```
- This line performs floor division using the `//` operator, which divides 5 by 2 and rounds down to the nearest whole number. The result is 2, which is printed.

### Checking Data Types

```python
print(type(10))                        # Int
```
- The `type()` function checks the data type of the value `10`. Since `10` is an integer, the output will be `<class 'int'>`.

```python
print(type(3.14))                      # Float
```
- This checks the data type of `3.14`. Since it is a decimal number, the output will be `<class 'float'>`.

```python
print(type(1 + 3j))                    # Complex
```
- Here, we check the type of `1 + 3j`, which is a complex number. The output will be `<class 'complex'>`.

```python
print(type('Asabeneh'))                # String
```
- This line checks the type of the string `'Asabeneh'`. The output will be `<class 'str'>`.

```python
print(type([1, 2, 3]))                 # List
```
- This checks the type of the list `[1, 2, 3]`. The output will be `<class 'list'>`.

```python
print(type({'name':'KhatoonInTech'}))  # Dictionary
```
- Here, we check the type of the dictionary `{'name':'KhatoonInTech'}`. The output will be `<class 'dict'>`.

```python
print(type({9.8, 3.14, 2.7}))          # Set
```
- This line checks the type of the set `{9.8, 3.14, 2.7}`. The output will be `<class 'set'>`.

```python
print(type((9.8, 3.14, 2.7)))          # Tuple
```
- Finally, this checks the type of the tuple `(9.8, 3.14, 2.7)`. The output will be `<class 'tuple'>`.

### Conclusion

This code provides a simple introduction to basic arithmetic operations and data types in Python. It is a great starting point for beginners to understand how to perform calculations and identify different data types.
